This is a standalone kernel module for the Arm TrustZone CryptoCell 63p REE device.

To build, first set the following envrionment variables

$ export KERNEL_DIR=/home/gby/src/linux/output/arm64/4.10/
$ export ARCH=arm64
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

Then issue the following command:

$ make -f Makefile.setup 

Note: recent kernel version have added a check that limits async. hash transformation
providers state context sizes in a way which is not compatible with this driver.
To get around this limitation apply the patch found in the patches/ directory.
